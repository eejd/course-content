        "This is the first in a series of two core tutorials on Bayesian statistics. In these tutorials, we will explore the fundemental concepts of the Bayesian approach from two perspectives. This tutorial will work through an example of Bayesian inference and decision making using a binary hidden state. The second main tutorial extends these concepts to a continuous hidden state. In the next days, each of these basic ideas will be extended--first through time as we consider what happens when we infere a hidden state using multiple observations and when the hidden state changes across time. In the third day, we will introduce the notion of how to use inference and decisions to select actions for optimal control. For this tutorial, you will be introduced to our binary state fishing problem!\n",

This does not depend on state so is essentially a constant we can often ignore. We can compare the unnormalized posterior distribution values for different states because how they relate to each other is unchanged when divided by the same constant.
